# Ruby on Racetracks Tutorials and How-To Guides

Welcome to the tutorials for getting started with [Ruby on Racetracks](http://www.rubyonracetracks.com/)!  Do NOT be intimated by the large number of chapters in some tutorials.  Each chapter is kept reasonably short so that you don't lose track of what you're doing.

## VirtualBox
[VirtualBox Tutorial](https://github.com/rubyonracetracks/tutorial-virtualbox): If you are a Mac or Windows user, please install a Linux virtual machine for using Docker.

## Docker
[Docker Tutorial - Debian Stretch](https://github.com/rubyonracetracks/tutorial-docker-stretch): Using Docker with Ruby on Rails pre-installed allows you to be ready to roll in minutes, not hours.  Please note that my way of using Docker is different from the conventional ways.
